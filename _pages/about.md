Hi 👋! I'm **Xinyi Zhang**, a 4th-year undergraduate student at Shandong University, under the excellent guidance of Prof. [Ruixuan Yu](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/yuruixuan/zh_CN/index.htm). Upon graduation, I will be pursuing my master's degree at Xi'an Jiaotong University, advised by Prof. [Qidong Liu](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/lqdong) and Prof. [Chen Li](https://chenli.group/).

My research interests are primarily focused on Computer Vision, Recommender Systems, and Large Language Models (LLMs). Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss potential collaborations or share ideas!
